# TODO

Deferred work — short, dated, status-tracked entries. Not for root-cause writeups (those go in
NOTES.md) or session logs (SESSION.md). When an entry is started, move it under "In Progress" with
the date; when done, delete it (the commit/SESSION.md entry is the permanent record).

## Pending

- **[2026-06-19] Remove theme inheritance from "The Color Purple."** Every theme currently resolves
  via `_resolve_theme()` as `THEMES["The Color Purple"].copy()` overlaid with the requested theme's
  own dict — any key a theme doesn't define falls back to Purple's literal value, not to that
  theme's own derived fallback (e.g. an accent-derived color). `_NO_BASE_INHERIT_KEYS` in
  `themes.py` is a manually-maintained escape hatch for keys where this is wrong, and it's easy to
  forget to update when adding a new optional key (see CLAUDE.md rule on `_NO_BASE_INHERIT_KEYS`,
  added 2026-06-19). Made sense early when Purple was a stable default; doesn't anymore — Purple
  probably won't even ship as the default theme. Target design: no theme inherits literal values
  from another theme; every key is either required (defined in all themes) or has a documented
  code-level fallback chain, never "whatever the base template happened to set."
  **Blocked on:** user's planned full pass over every theme (adding keys where current fallbacks
  don't look right) — doing the inheritance refactor before that pass would only have a partial
  picture of which keys actually need it. Revisit once that pass is done.
