## Multi-file MP3 virtual timeline — RESOLVED (2026-05-15)

**Problem:** Multi-file MP3 folders (N .mp3 files per book) could not be seeked globally, navigated by chapter, or advanced naturally across files. Two earlier implementations were reverted — concat:// blocked on backward seeks; partial VT without signal separation caused quadruple-advance feedback loops.

**Architecture:**
- `book_files` DB table stores per-file `{file_path, sort_order, duration_ms, cumulative_start_ms}`, populated by the scanner. Player reads this at load time (no mutagen re-scan).
- `_virtual_timeline` list on Player holds `{file_path, cumulative_start, duration}` entries. Player translates global positions into (file_index, local_offset) and issues `instance.play(target_file)` + `_pending_local_pos` for cross-file seeks.
- `book_ready` signal fires once per book (before any file for VT; after file-loaded for non-VT). `file_switched` fires per VT file load. This separation eliminates the feedback loop: `_on_file_ready` is not connected to `file_loaded` at all.

**Why book_ready fires from two different places:** VT books need it before any file loads (so position restore sets `_pending_local_pos` on the right file). Non-VT books need it after file-loaded (so `self.player.duration` is valid when the slider animation reads it). This asymmetry is intentional.

**Natural EOF advancement:** `keep_open='always'` means mpv never fires end-file with reason_int=0 (EOF) — it always fires RESTARTED (reason_int=2). All EOF detection goes through `_on_pause_test` near-EOF position check. `_is_vt_file_switch` gates `_on_pause_test` during file-load transient pauses to prevent quadruple-advance.

**Chapter tracking for VT:** `Player.chapter` getter walks `_chapter_list` by global `time_pos`. `_on_time_pos_change` emits `chapter_changed` whenever the global chapter index changes (compared to `_last_vt_chapter`). `ChapterList._activate_item` calls `seek_async(target_time)` for VT books instead of `self.player.chapter = idx`.

**What not to do:**
- Do not connect `_on_file_ready` to `file_loaded` — this was the root cause of the feedback loop in Round 2.
- Do not use `self.player.chapter` (mpv local) for VT books anywhere — it reflects per-file chapter index, not global.
- Do not read `self.progress_slider.value()` in `_on_file_ready` for switch animation — the slider may not have been updated yet (gated on `not slider_animating and not is_seeking`). Always compute from `new_progress / self.player.duration`.
- `keep_open='always'` makes `_on_end_file` reason_int=0 unreachable — do not add EOF logic there.

## MP3 seek blocks Qt main thread — RESOLVED (2026-05-14)

**Root cause:** `self.instance.time_pos = value` in python-mpv is synchronous — holds the GIL on the calling thread until libmpv acks the seek. For MP3 streams, libmpv scans backwards through the bitstream to find frame boundaries before acking. Called from slider release handlers on the Qt main thread → 10–30s freeze.

**Fix:**
- `Player.seek_async(pos)` uses `command_async('seek', pos, 'absolute+exact')` — non-blocking, returns immediately. `absolute+exact` preserves hr-seek precision.
- `seek_within_chapter` returns the computed `new_pos` so callers never need to read `time_pos` back after a seek.
- All four hot-path properties (`time_pos`, `duration`, `pause`, `speed`) cached via `observe_property` — reads no longer cross the IPC boundary.
- `is_seeking` clearance moved into `_on_time_pos_change` observer (fires when mpv delivers the settled position) — removed from the 200ms polling loop where it fired prematurely.

**What is intentionally left on sync path:** `apply_smart_rewind`, skip buttons, chapter nav, book-load position restore. Not slider-driven, not the problem path.

**`_seek_target = None` edge case:** If `seek_async` is called and `_seek_target` is `None` when the observer fires, `is_seeking` still clears (the `_seek_target is None` branch). This is safe — it means no target was set, so any position qualifies as settled. The edge case that previously caused 228% progress was from an earlier implementation that used `_seek_target` in the flow-animation path; that code was removed.

## Stats Panel — First-visit flash on Day/Week/Month tabs — RESOLVED

### Fix
`setVisible(False)` before `insertWidget`, then `setVisible(True)` immediately after, for each `BookDayRow` in all three refresh methods. Forces Qt to fully realize the widget before it is first painted. Applied to `_refresh_daily`, `_refresh_weekly`, `_refresh_monthly`.

### Symptom (was)
On first visit to each of Day, Week, Month tabs after app start, content flashed garbled for a split second then rendered correctly. Happened exactly once per tab per session — second visit was clean. Overall tab (no `BookDayRow` widgets) unaffected.

### What was tried and failed
- **DPR fix on thumbnails** — wrong diagnosis, covers are not the cause
- **`setFixedHeight` on `BookDayRow`** — wrong diagnosis
- **`addStretch()` → `setAlignment(AlignTop)`** — wrong diagnosis; also changed `insertWidget`/clear loop as collateral
- **`setUpdatesEnabled(False)` + `QTimer.singleShot(0)` re-enable** — wrong diagnosis
- **Pre-populating all tabs before `show()`** — wrong diagnosis
- **`ElidedLabel.showEvent` override** — no change
- **Disabling elision entirely** — no change; elision is not the cause
- **`ensurePolished()` on each row after insert** — no change
- **`QTimer.singleShot(0, window().update() + processEvents())`** — no change
- **`setVisible(False)` → insert → `setVisible(True)` on each row** — **THIS WORKED** (see fix above)

### What is known
- The flash is the entire row content (text + layout), not just thumbnails
- It is not a DPR, cover loading, layout stretch, or stylesheet timing issue (all ruled out)
- Root cause undiagnosed. Do not re-attempt the above.

## Sleep Timer

### State not persisted across restarts
`config.get_sleep_duration()` and `config.get_sleep_mode()` exist and are written by `SleepTimerPanel.set_sleep_timer()` ([sleep_timer.py:130–137](src/fabulor/ui/sleep_timer.py#L130-L137)), but nothing reads them on startup. `SleepTimerPanel.__init__` always starts with `_sleep_timer_end_time = None` and `_sleep_mode = None`. Whether to restore sleep timer state across restarts is a product decision. Address when sleep timer feature is next touched.

## Panel Animation — Deferred Fixes

### `library_panel_animation.finished` duplicate connection risk — `_start_library_entry` and `_close_library_flow`
`_start_library_entry` ([panels.py:86](src/fabulor/ui/panels.py#L86)) connects `finished` → `_on_library_shown` with no guard against the animation already running. `_close_library_flow` ([panels.py:223](src/fabulor/ui/panels.py#L223)) does the same for `_on_library_hidden`. If either is called twice before the animation completes, a second connection accumulates; the self-disconnect in `_on_library_shown`/`_on_library_hidden` only clears one copy per firing. Most paths are guarded (`_close_library_flow` checks `Running` at line 212; the sidebar path serialises through `_on_sidebar_closed_for_panel`), so the race is low frequency but real. Fix when panel animation code is next touched: add the disconnect-before-connect pattern matching the other animation handlers.

---

## Known Architectural Debt

### _cover_cache has no eviction — unbounded growth
`_cover_cache` ([library.py:43](src/fabulor/ui/library.py#L43)) is a module-level `dict` keyed by `book_id (int) → QPixmap`. It grows for the lifetime of the session and is never pruned. At ~226×344px JPEG-decoded to RGBA in memory, each entry is roughly 300 KB. 500 user-added covers (125+ books × 4 slots, all loaded in one session) would consume ~150 MB. Not a realistic v1 scenario given the 4-per-book cap. Revisit if the cap is raised or if memory pressure is reported. Fix when ready: LRU eviction keyed on last-visible timestamp, sized to ~200 entries.

---

### Book switch state split on DB failure — `_on_book_selected_from_library`
`_on_book_selected_from_library` ([app.py:1449–1458](src/fabulor/app.py#L1449-L1458)) sets `current_file = path`, then fires `db.update_last_played`, `config.set_last_book`, and `player.load_book` as four sequential side effects with no rollback. If `db.update_last_played` raises (disk full, locked DB), `current_file` already points at the new book but mpv is still playing the old one. Subsequent `_update_ui_sync` ticks write position data for the new path keyed against the old mpv session. Fix requires either: (a) a transaction wrapper that rolls back `current_file` and config on failure, or (b) delaying `current_file` assignment until after all DB writes succeed. Not a common failure mode — DB operations would need to be failing for this to trigger.

### Stats page sluggishness on Weekly and Monthly tabs
RESOLVED: BookDayRow and FinishedBookThumb now load covers asynchronously via CoverLoaderWorker, with placeholder fallback and _cover_cache hit check.

---

## Book Switch Sequence — Known Remaining Issues

### cover_path can be an audio file path in edge case
Scanner sets `cover_path = str(af)` (audio file) when no external image exists but the file has embedded art. It then immediately extracts and saves a `.jpg` thumbnail, replacing `cover_path` with the thumbnail path. So the DB normally always stores a `.jpg` path. Exception: if `img.save()` fails (disk full, permissions), the audio file path is stored instead. `CoverLoaderWorker` calls `QImage.load()` on it, which returns a null image. `_on_cover_loaded` discards null images silently — result is a missing cover, not a crash. No fix applied; failure mode is acceptable.

---

### Cover cache — cold start still hits mutagen
`_load_cover_art` checks `_cover_cache.get(file_path)` before calling mutagen. Cache is keyed by audiobook path and populated by the library panel's `CoverLoaderWorker`. On a warm session (library opened at least once), cache hits are instant. On cold start (library never opened this session), cache is empty and mutagen runs as before. Resolving cold-start requires either: (a) storing cover thumbnails on disk during scan, or (b) populating the cache independently on first book load.

### library_controller must not hide metadata_label when a book is loaded
`apply_library_state` ([library_controller.py:126](src/fabulor/library_controller.py#L126)) previously called `update_metadata(None, show_metadata=False)` unconditionally when `has_book=True`. This hid the "author - title" fallback set by `_load_cover_art` for no-cover books. Fixed by removing `show_metadata=False` from that call — `_load_cover_art` is now the sole owner of `metadata_label` visibility when a book is playing. Do not restore the `show_metadata=False` there.

### `book_covers` pre-migration books — fallback behavior
Both the preloader and `_trigger_cover_load` now call `get_active_cover_path(book.path)` before constructing `CoverLoaderWorker`. For books with no `book_covers` entry, `get_active_cover_path` returns `None` and the worker falls back to `book.cover_path` (scanner thumbnail) — same visual result as before, consistently applied. The previous asymmetry (preloader ignoring `book_covers`) was a bug, not intentional. No further action needed; when all books are rescanned the fallback path becomes a no-op.

### Panel close delay on book switch — RESOLVED (2026-05-13)
The stutter on book selection was caused by mpv's audio pipeline initialisation (PulseAudio negotiation on background threads) competing with the Qt animation timer at the OS scheduler level — not a main-thread block. Confirmed by timing: every Python step was under 2ms, but the animation still stuttered. Back-button close (no mpv work) was always smooth; this was the diagnostic signal.

**The fix — three-part sequence:**

1. **`_playlist_resolved` worker thread** (`player.py`): `_resolve_playlist` (mutagen reads) moved to `QThreadPool` worker. Result is held in `_held_play` rather than calling `instance.play()` immediately.

2. **Gate/ungate pattern** (`player.py`): `load_book` sets `_play_gated = True`. `_on_playlist_resolved` stores the resolved target in `_held_play` if still gated, or plays immediately if gate already lifted. `ungate_play()` either drains `_held_play` or sets `_play_gated = False` for future resolution. This means `instance.play()` — the call that kicks off PulseAudio init — never fires until after the animation completes.

3. **`_mpv_ready` flag** (`app.py`): `_on_book_selected_from_library` sets `_mpv_ready = False`. The deadzone in `_update_ui_sync` ignores all `mpv_pos` values while `_mpv_ready` is False. `_mpv_ready = True` is set in `_on_library_hidden` (library path) or directly before `ungate_play()` (startup/EOF-restart paths). This prevents the 200ms UI timer from accepting the previous book's stale position during the animation window and writing it to the slider.

**`ungate_play()` call sites:** `_on_library_hidden` (library flow), startup book restore, EOF restart. Any new `load_book` call that bypasses the library panel must also call `_mpv_ready = True` then `ungate_play()` immediately after.

**`_on_file_ready` / `_on_file_loaded_populate_chapters` deferral:** Both check `library_panel._is_animating` and set deferred flags if True. `_on_library_hidden` drains them via `QTimer.singleShot(50, _drain_deferred_file_ready)`. The 50ms is intentional — avoids last-frame compositor hitch.

**What was tried and failed:**
- Deferring only `_load_cover_art` and `load_book` via `singleShot(0)` — not enough; `instance.play()` still fired one event loop cycle into the animation.
- `is_seeking` guard on `_sync_progress_sliders` — broke flow animation because `is_seeking` clears before mpv delivers real position.
- `_seek_target` proximity check — caused 228% progress when `target=None` or book had no saved position.
- Skipping `_update_ui_sync` when `is_seeking=True` in `_on_file_ready` — broke flow animation because slider value was 0 when `animate_to` was called.
- Deferred slider animation from deadzone `is_seeking` transition — fired on wrong tick, reading wrong slider value.

**Unobvious:** The stutter root cause is OS scheduler, not Python. Python profiling and timing showed nothing. The diagnostic was: back button (identical slide, no mpv work) was always smooth.

### Position restore fragility
`_restore_position` re-reads from DB after `config_pos` sync. If `_current_book` (set at the top of `_on_file_ready`) was read before the sync, its `progress` value may be stale. The current workaround is a fresh `db.get_book()` call inside `_restore_position`. This is a second DB read on the file-ready path. Could be eliminated by moving the config sync earlier (before `db.get_book` in `_on_file_ready`), but requires care — `_current_book` is used by the slider animation logic immediately after.

### mpv `loadfile start=` option does not work
Tested with `instance.loadfile(path, start=str(int(seconds)))` and `f"+{int(seconds)}"`. mpv reports `time_pos=0.0` after `file-loaded` fires regardless. python-mpv's `loadfile` encodes options correctly (`key=value` string) but the seek either doesn't apply or is overridden. If this ever works in a future python-mpv/mpv version, `time_pos` assignment in `_restore_position` can be replaced entirely.

## Library Panel — Open/Close Performance (CLOSE STUTTER RESOLVED 2026-05-13 — open performance still has open items)

Current state: close slide on book selection is smooth. Open performance is unchanged.

### What was attempted this session and reverted

**Attempt 1 — refresh() after animation (old behavior, worked but caused blank flash)**
`_on_library_shown` called `refresh()` after slide-in. `refresh()` does full DB read + model reset + cover load. Caused visible blank flash before content appeared. This was the original code.

**Attempt 2 — on_open() replacing refresh() (BROKE EVERYTHING)**
Added `LibraryPanel.on_open()` which only called `update_current_book_progress()`. Replaced `refresh()` call in `_on_library_shown` with `on_open()`. This broke: progress not saved correctly, Recent/Progress sorts not updating, dynamic time updates broken. Root cause: `refresh()` does more than populate books — it also updates all books' speed-adjusted durations and re-applies sort/filter. `on_open()` didn't replicate this. REVERTED.

**Attempt 3 — mpv callback deferral (partially correct, needs retesting)**
`_on_file_ready` and `_on_file_loaded_populate_chapters` deferred via `library_panel_animation.finished` signal when animation was running. This eliminated the burst-retry timer loop. Deferred flags `_file_ready_deferred` and `_chaps_deferred` prevented double-connecting. 50ms singleShot after `finished` to avoid last-frame compositor hitch. This was CORRECT and did not break anything — it was rolled back only because it was bundled with the broken on_open() commit.

**Attempt 4 — preload callback guard (correct)**
`_on_preload_cover_loaded` now checks `_is_animating` before `notify_cover_cached`. This was correct and did not break anything — rolled back only because bundled.

**Attempt 5 — List mode text layout cache (correct)**
`_list_row_layout()` caches `fm.horizontalAdvance()` and `fm.elidedText()` results per `(book.path, available_width)`. Cleared on theme change, view mode change, refresh(). This was correct and did not break anything — rolled back only because bundled.

**Attempt 6 — row pixmap cache (broke List hover effects)**
Pre-rendering list rows to QPixmap. Broke trailing hover fade effect and elision-on-hover because those are per-frame dynamic. Reverted. The right approach: cache only the static layer (bg + text + progress), paint hover effects live on top. Not implemented correctly.

**Attempt 7 — setUpdatesEnabled(False) during slide-in/out (caused ghost)**
Suppressing repaints on _list_view during animation caused transparent panel ghost in List and 1-per-row modes — the panel appeared as a skeleton sliding over the content. Root cause: suppressing updates prevented Qt from clearing the panel's painted content as it moved. REVERTED.

**Attempt 8 — opacity animation instead of pos (not a fair test)**
Replaced QPropertyAnimation on pos with opacity. Other panels slide fine, so this wasn't comparable. Reverted.

### What the debug output showed
- `[FILE_READY] animating=True` and `[POPULATE_CHAPS] animating=True` — mpv fires file-loaded during the 300ms animation on fast SSDs. These callbacks hit the main thread and compete with the compositor.
- `[UI_SYNC] fired during animation` — 200ms timer fires 1-2 times during animation. Tests showed this is NOT the cause — it fires during smooth animations too.

---

## ChapterList — Deferred Fixes (2026-05-15)

### `fade_out` signal accumulation — DEFERRED

`fade_out` ([chapter_list.py:179](src/fabulor/ui/chapter_list.py#L179)) calls `_disconnect_hide` before connecting `_on_fade_out_finished`, and sets `_hide_connected = True`. If `fade_out` is called twice before the animation completes, the second call disconnects the first connection (via `_disconnect_hide`) and creates a new one. The first animation's `finished` fires with no handler; the second fires correctly. The `_anim.stop()` call resets animation state so the two calls don't compound. **Safe in practice.** The `_hide_connected` flag is semantically stale between `_on_fade_out_finished` returning and the next `_disconnect_hide` call, but this window is never observable — `_disconnect_hide` is only called from `fade_out` and `show_above`, both of which immediately follow with a fresh connect. Defer until chapter list animation is next refactored.

### `_activate_item` accesses `player._virtual_timeline` directly — DEFERRED

`_activate_item` ([chapter_list.py:283](src/fabulor/ui/chapter_list.py#L283)) reads `self.player._virtual_timeline` to decide whether to call `seek_async` or set `self.player.chapter`. This is a coupling violation — `ChapterList` depends on a private Player attribute. The correct fix is a public `Player.is_virtual_timeline` property (or routing all chapter activation through a single Player method that handles both cases internally). Defer until a Player public API review pass. Do not access `_virtual_timeline` from any other UI file in the meantime.
- Skipping `_update_ui_sync` entirely during animation caused transparent ghost panel. Not viable.
- `valueChanged` on QPropertyAnimation fires only twice (start/end positions), not per frame — measuring frame gaps via valueChanged is meaningless.

### Confirmed facts
- Other panels (settings, speed, sleep, stats) slide perfectly — library-specific problem.
- Empty library slides in/out smoothly — book content weight causes the stutter.
- Back button close (no book load): smooth.
- Book load close: stutters near end — mpv file-loaded fires during last frames.
- Grid modes: open smooth, close mostly smooth.
- List mode open: stutter proportional to book count (~17 visible rows of heavy paint).
- GTX 1060 won't help — Qt animation driver is CPU-bound, GPU only does final composite.

### What to do next (correct order)

1. **Re-apply mpv callback deferral** (Attempt 3) — tested, correct, no side effects. Apply to app.py only. Test: load books, verify progress saves, sorts work, dynamic updates work BEFORE looking at animation.

2. **Re-apply preload callback guard** (Attempt 4) — one line change, correct. Test same.

3. **Re-apply List mode text layout cache** (Attempt 5) — correct, no side effects. Test same.

4. **Fix library open flash WITHOUT breaking refresh()** — the correct approach: call `refresh()` BEFORE `show()` while panel is at `-panel_w` (off-screen). The panel is populated before the first visible frame. The `_after_covers` retry loop in `refresh()` will wait for `visualRect` to be non-empty, which happens naturally after the animation ends. Do NOT replace `refresh()` with a lightweight alternative — it does too much.

5. **Row pixmap cache for List mode** — cache static layer (bg, alternating color, stripe for non-playing rows, text, progress bar, time) keyed on `(book.path, row_width, row_height, row_parity, is_playing_paused, pct_bucket, show_rem)`. Paint hover effects live on top in all cases. Skip cache for the actively pulsing playing row. This eliminates the paint-heavy slide-in for List mode without suppressing updates.

### CRITICAL TESTING CHECKLIST before committing any library changes
- [ ] Open library → verify books shown correctly
- [ ] Select a book → verify progress saves after listening
- [ ] Reopen library → verify Recent sort shows updated book at top
- [ ] Verify Progress sort orders by percentage correctly
- [ ] Verify dynamic time updates tick every ~1 second while playing
- [ ] Close with Back button → smooth slide
- [ ] Close by selecting a book → check for ghost/stutter
- [ ] Open in List mode → check for ghost/skeleton
- [ ] Open in Grid modes → check content visible during slide

## Theme Transition — Long-term Plan

### Current state (as of 2026-05-10)
Overlay fade works correctly when no panels are open. When panels are open, automatic theme changes (cover theme, rotation) snap instantly. Settings panel hover preview animates correctly via overlay. The `user_initiated` flag distinguishes automatic from user-driven theme changes.

### Known remaining limitation
The overlay approach is fundamentally incompatible with any panel being open during a theme change — a frozen pixmap over an actively changing UI produces ghosts and dissolution artifacts. The current workaround (snap when panels are open) is acceptable for normal use.

### Long-term correct solution: per-element Q_PROPERTY color animation
Replace the overlay entirely with `QPropertyAnimation` on color properties of each widget. All custom-painted widgets are already instrumented (see session 2026-05-10). The remaining work is the QSS-driven majority:

**Why QPalette won't work:** Theme dicts have up to 30 semantic color keys across 50 themes. QPalette has a fixed role set that does not map onto this structure cleanly.

**What's required:** Convert QSS-driven widgets to use programmatic color assignment (via palette or stored attributes + custom painting) for color only, keeping QSS for structural styling (geometry, borders, fonts, hover/pressed states). Scope is wide — every button, label, background across all panels and tabs.

**When to do it:** After the UI is feature-complete and stable. This is a polish-pass architectural change. Do it as a dedicated session with no feature work mixed in.

**Widgets still needing instrumentation (THEME_ANIM_TODO):**
- `app.py`: `MainWindow`, `TitleBar`, `ChapterList`, `SpeedControlsPanel`, `AudioSettingsTab`, `SleepTimerPanel`, `StatsPanel`, `BookDetailPanel`, `status_banner`, `sidebar`, `vol_container`
- `chapter_list.py`: `ChapterList`
- `library.py`: `LibraryPanel`
- `stats_panel.py`: `ElidedLabel`, `SessionListWidget`, `BookDayRow`, `FinishedBookThumb`, `FinishedScrollRow`, `StatsPanel`
- `book_detail_panel.py`: `BookDetailPanel`, `_ClickableLabel`

## Themes Tab — Excluded from Per-Element Animation (2026-05-10)

The Settings panel Themes tab was audited and ruled out for per-element color animation. All other tabs are tamed (no custom-painted widgets, overlay runs over them cleanly). The Themes tab is the permanent exception.

### Widget inventory and color sources

| Widget | Theme keys | State mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `QTabBar::tab` | `bg_deep`, `accent`, `settings_tab_hover_*`, `accent_dark`, `button_text` | QSS pseudo-classes |
| `ThemeItem(QPushButton)` | `panel_theme_names_dimmed`, `accent`, `accent_light` | `[selected]`, `[active_display]` dynamic properties + unpolish/polish |
| Cover-mode / interval `QLabel` | `panel_theme_names_dimmed`, `accent` | `[selected]` dynamic property |
| `QLabel#settings_header` | `accent_light` | QSS only |
| `QLabel#theme_hint` | `accent` | QSS only |
| `QPushButton#theme_add/remove/change_now` | `text`, `accent_dark`, `accent`, `button_text` | QSS only |
| `QPushButton#pattern_button` | `panel_theme_names_dimmed`, `accent`, `accent_light`, `accent_dark`, `button_text` | `[selected]`, `[is_default]` dynamic properties |

### Why per-element animation is not viable

**Dynamic property state machine on ThemeItem**: Three visual states (dimmed / selected / active_display), six possible pairwise transitions. Each requires resolving both the source and target color from the current theme dict at the moment of the flip, then starting a `QPropertyAnimation`. The unpolish/polish mechanism would have to be suppressed and replaced entirely.

**QTabBar is not instrumentation-friendly**: Renders through `QStyle` internally. Animating tab colors requires subclassing `QTabBar`, overriding `paintTab`, and managing per-tab color state manually. Not feasible without a dedicated rewrite of the tab bar.

**N simultaneous instances**: Interval labels and ThemeItem pool buttons all flip state at once. Each instance needs its own animation with correct per-instance before/after colors computed at flip time.

**QPalette does not work when QSS is active**: Confirmed via `ThemedButton` canary test. Setting `QPalette.Button` is silently ignored when any QSS `background` rule applies to the widget — QSS takes full precedence. `background: transparent` in QSS causes the window background to show through rather than the palette color. The only working background path is a `paintEvent` override painting a rounded rect explicitly, which requires hardcoding `border-radius` to match QSS and loses QSS `:hover`/`:pressed` background states entirely.

### What works instead
`user_initiated` flag on `_on_theme_changed` + Themes-tab-active check: automatic theme changes (cover art, rotation) snap instantly when Themes tab is open. User-driven changes (hover preview, right-click, Change Now, mode buttons) animate normally. `snap_theme_forward()` on settings panel close prevents overlay dissolution during slide-out.

## Player / VT — Deferred Bug Investigations (2026-05-16)

### Prev chapter while paused goes to N-1 instead of restarting N — RESOLVED (2026-05-16)

Two root causes:

1. `previous_chapter()` non-VT was reading `self.chapter or 0` (mpv's async property) to identify the current chapter. When paused this value can lag. Fixed: replace with a walk of `chapter_list` against `time_pos + 0.35`, same as VT and display paths.

2. The "restart current chapter" case used `self.time_pos = chap_start` (default seek). Default seek undershoots by one AAC frame (~23ms). When paused, playback never advances past the boundary to self-correct; mpv kept reporting N-1. When playing, forward playback masked the undershoot in one tick. Fixed: `seek_async(chap_start + 0.35)` — `absolute+exact` seek plus epsilon to clear the ~0.25s float drift window.

### Chapter slider position wrong after Prev/Next chapter — RESOLVED (2026-05-16)

Root cause: time labels in `_sync_chapter_ui` update without an `is_seeking` guard; slider `setValue` was gated on `not is_seeking`. For `self.chapter = N` seeks, `_seek_target` is never set, so `_is_seeking` clears on the first `_on_time_pos_change` callback. Race: timer fires with label showing correct "00:00" but slider retaining the stale near-full value from the previous chapter. A `setValue(0)` call in `handle_prev`/`handle_next` made it worse — it was overwritten before the seek settled.

Fixed: remove `setValue(0)` from both handlers; remove `not self.player.is_seeking` from the chapter slider's `setValue` condition in `_sync_chapter_ui`. Keep the `chap_animating` guard — that is the architecturally protected one. The slider now updates every 200ms unconditionally and self-corrects within one tick.

### M4B chapter label shows previous chapter on book load — RESOLVED (2026-05-16)

Root cause: `_restore_position` non-VT used `self.player.time_pos = book_data.progress` (default seek). One-frame undershoot (~23ms) lands before the chapter boundary when saved position is at chapter N's start. mpv correctly reports N-1 for that position.

Three signal-path approaches failed — **do not retry**:
- **Timer correction in `_sync_chapter_ui`**: `_update_chapter_label_from_index` (signal path) never updated the tracking index so the correction never fired. Adding tracking there caused N-1→N flash on every book load.
- **Walk in `_on_time_pos_change` for non-VT**: fires on every audio frame including intermediate seek values. Caused N+2 flashes on Next and a regression cascade (stuck slider, broken label on all seeks).
- **Walk in `_on_chapter_change` with direct `instance.time_pos` read**: could not reliably get the post-seek position before the chapter callback fired.

Fixed at the seek: `_restore_position` now uses `seek_async(book_data.progress + 0.35)`. Restores 0.35s past the saved position — accepted trade-off, consistent with what `previous_chapter` does for the same reason.

**Rule: `chapter_changed` signal for non-VT must remain on `_on_chapter_change` (mpv's chapter property), not `_on_time_pos_change`.** VT uses `_on_time_pos_change` because VT chapter times are exact DB values; non-VT chapter times have ~0.25s float drift. The time_pos path cannot distinguish intermediate seek values from settled ones.

### M4B chapter label drift after slider/right-click seek — still intermittent
After a time-based seek (slider drag, right-click), mpv's `chapter` property can lag one tick before updating. The 200ms timer corrects the chapter slider (via `pos + 0.35` walk in `_sync_chapter_ui`) but the label is only driven by `_on_chapter_change`. Low-frequency. If revisited: a targeted post-seek one-shot check is the safest direction. Do not touch `_on_time_pos_change` for non-VT.

### Progress slider race on book switch
Symptom: slider briefly shows 0% before animating to the correct position on book switch. The flow animation in `_on_file_ready` calls `animate_to(target, old_value=_pre_switch_slider_value)`. If `_pre_switch_slider_value` was set correctly but the animation's start value is 0 (because `_update_ui_sync` ran with `is_seeking=True` and forced the slider to 0 during the deadzone window), the animation starts from 0. Guard already exists in `_sync_progress_sliders` (`if slider_animating: return`), but the race is between the deadzone clear and the animation start. Known, pre-existing.

### VT sessions not recorded correctly across file switches
`_close_session`/`_open_session` wiring does not account for mid-book VT file transitions. When mpv emits `file_switched`, the session layer treats it as a new play event rather than continuation of the same book. Accurate listening time attribution across VT file boundaries requires threading `file_switched` into the session recorder. Known pre-existing issue; address when session recording is next touched.

## Stats Panel — Timeline Tab Not Updated After Metadata Edit

`BookDetailPanel` emits `metadata_saved` when an inline field edit is committed. `StatsPanel` has no connection to this signal. The timeline tab's heatmap and the finished-books tab both show book titles — after an inline rename, they still show the old title until the panel is closed and reopened. Fix: connect `metadata_saved` → `stats_panel.refresh_current_tab()` (or a narrower `_refresh_time()` call if only the timeline needs updating). Address when stats panel or book detail panel is next touched.

## Cover Panel — Deferred Issues (2026-05-16)

### Duplicate cover detection not implemented
`_on_add_cover` ([cover_panel.py:497](src/fabulor/ui/cover_panel.py#L497)) copies the selected file into the book's cover directory without checking if an identical image already exists (by content hash or file size + dimensions). A user adding the same image twice creates redundant copies on disk and redundant DB rows. Implement before the cover panel slot limit (4) becomes a user-visible constraint — a duplicate wastes a slot.

### `upsert_cover` delete ordering — file before DB
On cover deletion, the current implementation deletes the file before the DB row. If the DB delete fails (locked, disk error), the file is gone but the DB still references it — the thumbnail shows a broken image on next open. The correct order is: delete DB row first, then delete file. If the file delete fails, the DB is clean and the orphaned file is harmless (not referenced). Address when cover panel is next touched.

### `_on_thumb_delete` does not check file delete return value
`_on_thumb_delete` ([cover_panel.py:444](src/fabulor/ui/cover_panel.py#L444)) calls the delete operation but does not inspect whether the file was successfully removed. A silent failure leaves an unreferenced file on disk. At minimum, log the failure. Address alongside the ordering fix above.

## Cleanup Deferrals — Pre-existing, Deliberate (2026-05-16)

These items exist in the codebase intentionally and should not be removed without a dedicated cleanup pass.

### Debug prints and timing instrumentation
`_close_session`, `_on_file_ready`, `_on_book_selected_from_library` contain `print()` calls and timing probes left from VT debugging. Remove in a dedicated cleanup commit — do not remove piecemeal during feature work.

### Temp buttons in status banner
`next_quote_btn` and `temp_settings_btn` in the status banner are placeholder UI. Their click handlers delegate to panel flows that have permanent entry points elsewhere. Remove when the status banner layout is finalized.

### Temp EOF flags
`_eof_event_written` and `_eof_dur_fetched` flags, and associated `#Temporary` comments, were added to guard double-write during EOF session close. Review whether they are still necessary after the session recording rewrite for VT. Do not remove blindly — check whether the guard condition is still reachable.

### Temp file accumulation for VT playlist resolution
`_resolve_playlist` writes `ffmetadata` and `concat` files with `delete=False` (or equivalent) for debugging. These accumulate in `/tmp` across sessions. Switch to `delete=True` or explicit cleanup in a `finally` block when VT is considered stable.

### Config — `balance` key has no bounds validation
`config.set_balance(value)` writes whatever it receives. The audio tab constrains input to `[-1.0, 1.0]` via the slider, but the config layer has no clamp. A manually edited or corrupted QSettings file can store an out-of-range value that passes silently to mpv's audio filter. Add `max(-1.0, min(1.0, value))` in `set_balance` when config is next touched.
