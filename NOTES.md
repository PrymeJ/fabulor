## Known Architectural Debt

### _update_speed_grid_styling in settings_controller.py
Misnamed — orchestrates all panel visual updates, not just speed grid.
Rename to `_refresh_panel_visuals` when refactoring SettingsController.

### Stats page sluggishness on Weekly and Monthly tabs
RESOLVED: BookDayRow and FinishedBookThumb now load covers asynchronously via CoverLoaderWorker, with placeholder fallback and _cover_cache hit check.

### CoverLoaderWorker constructor in stats_panel.py
BookDayRow and FinishedBookThumb construct CoverLoaderWorker using an anonymous type (`type('_BD', (), {...})`) to satisfy the Book dataclass signature, passing None as the player instance (safe — run() doesn't use it).
This is fragile. When the path→ID migration happens, either give CoverLoaderWorker a simpler constructor overload, or extract a separate lightweight worker for non-library cover loads.

## Library Panel — Open/Close Performance (UNRESOLVED — do not touch without full test plan)

Current state (at commit e0ec581): everything works correctly. No performance fixes applied.

### What was attempted this session and reverted

**Attempt 1 — refresh() after animation (old behavior, worked but caused blank flash)**
`_on_library_shown` called `refresh()` after slide-in. `refresh()` does full DB read + model reset + cover load. Caused visible blank flash before content appeared. This was the original code.

**Attempt 2 — on_open() replacing refresh() (BROKE EVERYTHING)**
Added `LibraryPanel.on_open()` which only called `update_current_book_progress()`. Replaced `refresh()` call in `_on_library_shown` with `on_open()`. This broke: progress not saved correctly, Recent/Progress sorts not updating, dynamic time updates broken. Root cause: `refresh()` does more than populate books — it also updates all books' speed-adjusted durations and re-applies sort/filter. `on_open()` didn't replicate this. REVERTED.

**Attempt 3 — mpv callback deferral (partially correct, needs retesting)**
`_on_file_ready` and `_on_file_loaded_populate_chapters` deferred via `library_panel_animation.finished` signal when animation was running. This eliminated the burst-retry timer loop. Deferred flags `_file_ready_deferred` and `_chaps_deferred` prevented double-connecting. 50ms singleShot after `finished` to avoid last-frame compositor hitch. This was CORRECT and did not break anything — it was rolled back only because it was bundled with the broken on_open() commit.

**Attempt 4 — preload callback guard (correct)**
`_on_preload_cover_loaded` now checks `_is_animating` before `notify_cover_cached`. This was correct and did not break anything — rolled back only because bundled.

**Attempt 5 — List mode text layout cache (correct)**
`_list_row_layout()` caches `fm.horizontalAdvance()` and `fm.elidedText()` results per `(book.path, available_width)`. Cleared on theme change, view mode change, refresh(). This was correct and did not break anything — rolled back only because bundled.

**Attempt 6 — row pixmap cache (broke List hover effects)**
Pre-rendering list rows to QPixmap. Broke trailing hover fade effect and elision-on-hover because those are per-frame dynamic. Reverted. The right approach: cache only the static layer (bg + text + progress), paint hover effects live on top. Not implemented correctly.

**Attempt 7 — setUpdatesEnabled(False) during slide-in/out (caused ghost)**
Suppressing repaints on _list_view during animation caused transparent panel ghost in List and 1-per-row modes — the panel appeared as a skeleton sliding over the content. Root cause: suppressing updates prevented Qt from clearing the panel's painted content as it moved. REVERTED.

**Attempt 8 — opacity animation instead of pos (not a fair test)**
Replaced QPropertyAnimation on pos with opacity. Other panels slide fine, so this wasn't comparable. Reverted.

### What the debug output showed
- `[FILE_READY] animating=True` and `[POPULATE_CHAPS] animating=True` — mpv fires file-loaded during the 300ms animation on fast SSDs. These callbacks hit the main thread and compete with the compositor.
- `[UI_SYNC] fired during animation` — 200ms timer fires 1-2 times during animation. Tests showed this is NOT the cause — it fires during smooth animations too.
- Skipping `_update_ui_sync` entirely during animation caused transparent ghost panel. Not viable.
- `valueChanged` on QPropertyAnimation fires only twice (start/end positions), not per frame — measuring frame gaps via valueChanged is meaningless.

### Confirmed facts
- Other panels (settings, speed, sleep, stats) slide perfectly — library-specific problem.
- Empty library slides in/out smoothly — book content weight causes the stutter.
- Back button close (no book load): smooth.
- Book load close: stutters near end — mpv file-loaded fires during last frames.
- Grid modes: open smooth, close mostly smooth.
- List mode open: stutter proportional to book count (~17 visible rows of heavy paint).
- GTX 1060 won't help — Qt animation driver is CPU-bound, GPU only does final composite.

### What to do next (correct order)

1. **Re-apply mpv callback deferral** (Attempt 3) — tested, correct, no side effects. Apply to app.py only. Test: load books, verify progress saves, sorts work, dynamic updates work BEFORE looking at animation.

2. **Re-apply preload callback guard** (Attempt 4) — one line change, correct. Test same.

3. **Re-apply List mode text layout cache** (Attempt 5) — correct, no side effects. Test same.

4. **Fix library open flash WITHOUT breaking refresh()** — the correct approach: call `refresh()` BEFORE `show()` while panel is at `-panel_w` (off-screen). The panel is populated before the first visible frame. The `_after_covers` retry loop in `refresh()` will wait for `visualRect` to be non-empty, which happens naturally after the animation ends. Do NOT replace `refresh()` with a lightweight alternative — it does too much.

5. **Row pixmap cache for List mode** — cache static layer (bg, alternating color, stripe for non-playing rows, text, progress bar, time) keyed on `(book.path, row_width, row_height, row_parity, is_playing_paused, pct_bucket, show_rem)`. Paint hover effects live on top in all cases. Skip cache for the actively pulsing playing row. This eliminates the paint-heavy slide-in for List mode without suppressing updates.

### CRITICAL TESTING CHECKLIST before committing any library changes
- [ ] Open library → verify books shown correctly
- [ ] Select a book → verify progress saves after listening
- [ ] Reopen library → verify Recent sort shows updated book at top
- [ ] Verify Progress sort orders by percentage correctly
- [ ] Verify dynamic time updates tick every ~1 second while playing
- [ ] Close with Back button → smooth slide
- [ ] Close by selecting a book → check for ghost/stutter
- [ ] Open in List mode → check for ghost/skeleton
- [ ] Open in Grid modes → check content visible during slide
